# svelte-masonry

This is an implementation of Masonry based on this excellent article on CSS Tricks: https://css-tricks.com/a-lightweight-masonry-solution. It's really great. It requires no external dependencies, is super light-weight, etc.

Basically I just wrapped Svelte around the Masonry code as a reusable component.


## Usage

Add svelte-masonry to your package:

```
npm install svelte-masonry
```

or use yarn

```
yarn add svelte-masonry
```

- import the masonry component (TODO)

- use as a component / wrap around a {#each} block


### Options

- stretchFirst
- grid-gap
- col-width
